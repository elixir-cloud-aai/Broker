# Pubgrade

[![License][badge-license]][badge-url-license]

## Synopsis

Pubgrade is a decoupled, publish-subscribe-based continuous integration (CI) and
continuous delivery (CD) microservice that allows developers to notify
deployments of available updates, which can then autonomously decide what to do
with them. Pubgrade has an optional link
with [ELIXIR Cloud Service Registry][elixir-cloud-registry].
